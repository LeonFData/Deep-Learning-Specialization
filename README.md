Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI
##### Course Professor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

Machine learning techniques are evolving rapidly. I am always looking forward to learn and stay ahead. [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) is a fantastic program I found on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). I created this repository to show the courses materials, quizs and assignments I've finished. I have uploaded the certificates for completed courses.
