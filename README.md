# Deep Learning Specialization
Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI
##### Course Professor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

Machine learning techniques are evolving rapidly. I am always looking forward to learn and stay ahead. [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) is a fantastic program I found on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). I created this repository to show the courses materials, quizs and assignments I've finished. I have uploaded the certificates for completed courses.

## Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning (click to view [certificate](https://github.com/LeonFData/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/Course1%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Course%20Certificate.pdf))
- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture
